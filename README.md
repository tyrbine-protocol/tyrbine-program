# Tyrbine
Single-sided liquidity protocol on Solana

Earn trading fees **without impermanent loss** by depositing a single asset into Tyrbine vaults.

## Why Tyrbine?

Traditional AMMs require providing liquidity in pairs and expose users to impermanent loss.  
Tyrbine allows you to earn from the growing Solana ecosystem **with a single asset**, making liquidity provision simpler, safer, and more profitable.
