# Tyrbine
Single-sided liquidity protocol

## Description

Tyrbine is a single-sided liquidity protocol on Solana.  
Users can deposit a single asset into vaults and earn trading fees **without impermanent loss**.  

Key features include:  
- **Dynamic fees** that adjust based on vault liquidity, rewarding deposits to deficit vaults and discouraging withdrawals.  
- **Slippage-free swaps** using Pyth price oracles for fair pricing.  
- **Secure vaults** with internal reserves and circuit breakers to protect liquidity providers.
