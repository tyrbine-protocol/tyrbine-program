# Tyrbine
Single-sided liquidity protocol

## Description

Tyrbine is a single-sided liquidity protocol on Solana.  
Users can deposit a single asset into vaults and earn trading fees **without impermanent loss**.

>  The idea is to join the existing flow of liquidity on Solana and extract yield from it

Key features include:  
- **Phase Switch**
Incentivizes traders to rebalance liquidity by depositing into deficit vaults and withdrawing from surplus vaults, offering the best rates available across the Solana ecosystem.

- **Slippage-Free Swaps**
Swaps are powered by Pyth price oracles, ensuring accurate and transparent pricing with zero traditional slippage.

- **Secure Vaults**
Vaults are protected by internal reserves and automated circuit breakers, shielding liquidity providers from volatility and potential exploits
